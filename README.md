# Scientific Computing without the Command-line: An Intro to the Agave API

## Overview

High performance computing has become a critical resource in an increasing number of scientific disciplines. For many of these “nontraditional” computing communities, the learning curve to become proficient at the command-line is a burden, but it also constrains the computational side of that scientific domain to a subset of specialists. Conversely, bringing computationally demanding apps upon which a scientific community relies to a more accessible interface can provide a platform for broader adoption, collaboration, and ultimately accelerated discovery.

This workshop demonstrates how to use the Agave API to run complete scientific workflows using XSEDE high performance computing resources without touching the command-line. Through hands-on sessions, participants will look at managing and sharing data across XSEDE resources, and we will tackle how to orchestrate job execution across systems and capture metadata on the results (and the process) so that parameters and methodologies are not lost. We will guide users on how to leverage software modules on the system as well as custom code installed in user space. Finally, we will discuss examples how both individual labs as well as large projects are using XSEDE and Agave to provide web interfaces for everything from crop modeling to molecular simulations. The Agave API and all the tools used are open-source software.

## Pre-workshop Preparation

To participate in the workshop activities, you will need: 
* a laptop computer
* an account on the public Agave tenant [http://public.agaveapi.co/create_account](http://public.agaveapi.co/create_account).
